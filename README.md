## About me
I'm Lucas, I'm a senior at FSU currently in the process of wrapping up my undergraduate degree in computer science. I'm pursuing a minor in environmental science and working part-time as an intern in a junior software engineer position, and I'm hoping to get a lot of hands-on development practice this year!
